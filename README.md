# I'm Ruben,

I'm on the road to becoming a web developer and love the idea of mixing web skills with the business world for cool opportunities. Super excited about this journey!

## A Bit About Me

- **Learning Journey:** I'm currently learning to be a web developer while doing my school thing. I'm getting better at making websites and apps that look awesome and actually do stuff.

- **Tech Fan:** I really like web development and have been trying out different tech stuff:

  - **HTML/CSS:** Making websites look cool and work well.

  - **JavaScript:** Adding fun stuff to websites.

  - **PHP:** Learning about the backend of web development.

## What I'm Up To

While I'm working on getting better and learning, I'm also busy with some cool web projects:

- [Personal Portfolio](link-to-portfolio): Showing off my skills and projects (just a heads up, they're still in progress).

- debig5trilogie.nl : This is a website I made using wordpress for a writer (the website is dutch).

## How to Get in Touch

I'm always up for teamwork and sharing what I know. Hit me up using these links:
